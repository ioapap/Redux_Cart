# Redux_Cart App ðŸ›’
This is a dummy shopping cart app, designed to help understand how to use Redux with asynchronous code and side-effects. With this app, you can add products to your cart, control the quantity of items, and remove them when needed. We use Firebase as our database for managing data ðŸš€
## Features ðŸ’¡
- Toggle cart visibility by clicking the My Cart button
- Add products to the cart with the Add to Cart button
- If the product is already in the cart, the quantity will increase automatically
- Modify item quantity in the cart with Plus and Minus buttons
- If the quantity is 1 and you click Minus, the item will be removed entirely from the cart
- Redux DevTools integration for deep insights and time travel debugging

## Learning Outcomes ðŸ“š

By building this app it taught me: 
- How to use Redux with side-effects and asynchronous code
- Different ways to handle side-effects in components and action creators
- How to optimize your app by keeping components lean and focused on core tasks
- Leveraging reducers for data transformations
- Utilizing Redux DevTools for better understanding and debugging
